# creator-commentary
Chrome Extension to play an MP3 on a page, usually a YouTube video adding a secondary audio track.

This not only allows you to make a commentary track for your videos, but it also allows you to provide an alternate audio track.

Use Case:
You want your content to be advertiser friendly, so you censor yourself when uploading videos to YouTube.
However, much of your fanbase likes the explicit content.
You can upload the MP3 of the explicit version to your website, and link to it in the YouTube description.
Any fan who wants the explicit version can add this extension to Chrome.
When viewing your videos, the extension will find your linked MP3, and play it.

Known Short Comings:
Currently this extension does not monitor the video for Ads, so it will not synchronize.
The user will have to pause/unpause the MP3 manually to synchronize the video.
